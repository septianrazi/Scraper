I think it is bad for health and a safety concern. They should be replaced or left out of the oven altogether. I experienced it myself and I wonder if I would be affected from the inhalation when opening the heated oven or consuming the food in the oven that is filled with smoke and fumes.,3,2,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2581614208634520/

To the large group partying the Warren. Thank you so much for diligently moving down without being asked, I am very impressed and very appreciative of your efforts.
I would strongly suggest however that you all make an effort before leaving the area tonight to clean it up because the state it was in when I was on rounds is not going to make Nerilee very happy tomorrow if it remains like that. If Nerilee sees that tomorrow she is going to follow up with me and the Duty log and she might ask for names of people I saw in the Warren tonight if the warren is left in an unacceptable state like it is atm. Please don’t make me give names and respect the common space by cleaning it up after you are finished.

Hello Fenner fam! One of our favourite ex-SRs, Camille Inez, has been nominated as a Westfield Local Hero and needs your help now to win $10000 for her campaign. If you’ve got a spare 20 seconds, please consider voting for the incredible, talented and hard-working Founder and Director of The Stop Campaign, which is a registered not-for-profit that aims to end sexual violence on campus through empowerment and education. Every dollar goes straight to the non-profit and not to her personally.

Hey Fenner, tonight promises to be one of the biggest games of the season with the Wallabies taking on the All Blacks in the first Bledisloe Cup game. I’ll show it on the TV in the warren at 7:45pm for those who are interested.
There is also the women’s test beforehand which I’ll put up in the TV room. With the Wallaroos in unprecedented form it promises to be a cracker. Come along at 5pm to watch",1,9,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2169234559872489/

If you want to be part of the Fenner team, want to learn more about theatresports or if the Call of the Void draws you inexplicably towards the TV room on Thursday, come and join me at 6pm this Thursday! We will play through a few games and I'll explain more about the competition.
Theatresports is essentially competitive, structured improv comedy, and the Fenner team will compete against the other colleges in week 6. Fenner has actually historically done pretty well in theatresports (despite being ROBBED last year), so get keen for our comeback arc this year.
