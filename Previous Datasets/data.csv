🌳George Bush Week 🌳
This means you get to see all your favourite conspiracy theories. While covid restrictions will mean you can’t dress up in your aluminium foil hat for a bar night, you will still see the theme in other places.
It is also important to remember that some conspiracy theories are tied to historical events that caused a great deal of distress to people. There are also current conspiracy theories which may target particular countries or groups of people. While it is possible to have a great deal of fun with the theme, we are all adults and must remember to consider the impact of our behaviour and endeavour to minimise harm to all groups of Fenner residents. The FRC will be making every effort to ensure that no Fenner Resident feels unwelcome or uncomfortable as a result of the theme and we ask that you extend your fellow residents the same courtesy.
Keep an eye out for the soon to be released calendar of events and get ready to have some fun faking another moon landing, confronting the lizard people and having your flu shot.",7,32,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2915368378592433/

Hey Fenner, are you interested in coaching a sport in term 3? Sports that need coaches are:
AFL (Men*)
AFL 9s (Women*)
Netball (Women*)
Soccer (Men*)
Soccer (Women*)
Volleyball (Women*)
For Disc and Volleyball where we started but didn't finish playing games in term 1, they will resume in term 3. This means disc will still be coached by Liam Dooley and Alex Matters while men's volleyball will be coached by Calum Snowdon and Joshua Hammond. Women's volleyball only has Luka Mijnarends staying on so applications are open for another coach to join her.
ISO is planning to resume sports in term 3 however we don't know yet if ANU will sign off on it. I will keep you posted and let you know as soon as I find out. But for now, if you are interested in coaching, please apply.
This is very normal for first year residents to coach a sport, the only real pre-requisite is that you like the sport and know a little bit about it. Being good at it is not important at all.
There's more information in the form and if you have any questions, please just send myself or any of the other sports reps a message.",2,12,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2898205560308715/

Hey Fenner, 

I’d like to know what bush week themes you are interested in. Comment your favourite below or react the ones that I have commented if you like them. I will look at how many reactions each comment gets to help choose a theme, so react to your favourites. 

Keep in mind that with covid we won’t be able to have our normal bar nights where we normally showcase our theme but there’s a possibility that we can have a modified bar night and showcase the theme there instead. I’ll keep you posted on whether this is a possibility.

For those who haven’t been to a bush week yet, it’s kind of like semester 2 O-week. The only difference is that it’s held during week 1 when classes are on. So, you have to make sure you can still concentrate the next day rock up to class hungover.",1,15,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2895504157245522/

"Wednesday, 24 June 2020 at 9:23 am",Gabrielle Smith,"Hi Fenner, ex-ressie here! There is a residential job opportunity at my workplace that I thought might interest some of you potentially looking for different accommodation options for the remainder of this year.
The job is for a residential position at the boarding house of Canberra Girls Grammar School. In exchange for ~15hrs of work per week supervising the girls, you will receive full year accommodation (your own room with en-suite) and all your meals during term time. Think of it as being an SR but for girls in high school, and you get food included and your own bathroom! You also will be living in beautiful Deakin, a stones throw from Parliament House, Manuka and the lake.
A few requirements:
-You must be female
-must have FULL car drivers licence (you will sometimes have to drive the girls around in the school van)
- must have WWVP card
- any experience working with kids (tutoring, music, mentoring, after school care, etc - anything will help!)
I am a non-residential staff member and it’s a really rewarding job, flexible around uni and other work commitments and great experience!

Come Join us and Sign up for the Fenner Witch Hunt!
In a post-COVID world witches are blamed for the cause of all the town's problems. In Fennertown two factions of witches exist, one as a force of good and one of evil. To the town there is no difference between the two, they wish to rid Fennertown of them all. But for the Sister of the Martyr (Light Witches), their goal is to survive and rid the town from the wicked Church of Night (Dark Witches). Those suspicious of the Devil’s practice are trialled. So which side will you stand on, are you a force of good? Or evil? Or do you see no difference - a witch is a witch?

It’s 8pm on a bleak autumn’s evening.
You cut your bangs last night, but you haven’t been game enough to look in the mirror yet. You’ve already had three cups of Dalgona coffee today and yet somehow you still don’t have the energy to get up and memorise another Tik-Tok dance. Things are grim. It’s all you can do to vegetate on the sofa and try not to think about the mid-sems you have next week.
Suddenly, a post appears on your facebook. It descends, like an angel from above. Those three tablespoons of caffeine begin to bubble frantically through your internal organs. Creative writing, it says. Due on the 3rd of May.
Could this be it? Could this be the one thing that will let you procrastinate your studies, express your creative energies AND bring glory to your unspecified residential hall of choice?
You open a new Word document, and begin to type.

Take care of yourselves and message Phi, Jacqui, Susan or myself if you’re thinking of submitting something for Interhall creative writing ❤️)",4,15,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2711551312307475/

Good Evening Fenner Ressies!!!!
The social committee will be running a real-time virtual mafia event for the duration of week 7. All you need to do is fill out the expression of interest form below to register, with roles being allocated Sunday evening after 5pm.
This isn't a big commitment at all and is proposed merely for a fun way to stay connected and accuse your friends for dastardly deeds. So it won't take away from all that hard uni study I know you all are doing... :)
The Mafia party game presents a conflict between the Mafia – the informed minority – and the Townspeople – the uninformed majority. The game has two phases; night, when the Mafia might secretly “murder” an innocent, and “day” when Innocents vote to eliminate a Mafiosi suspect. The game ends when all the Mafia members are eliminated or there are more Mafia members than Innocents. However we also have several non-aligned roles working towards their own victory irrespective of the Mafia and the Town.
More information is provided in the event page below with the link to the google forms doc that you need to fill out to register.

https://forms.gle/orse8EuuSW1wd7KL7
Here’s an example post:
Submitted by Jake McCall
This is my study area. I’ve set up my desk looking out the window so I can get some sunlight and because I find the view calming (which helps me study). My dad alsways told me that you can’t study with a messy desk so I try to keep my desk fairly uncluttered. Instead I dump my random notes in piles under my desk. One thing I love about my study space is my big ass whiteboard. It’s one of the first things I bought when I moved out of home and it’s turned out very useful recently. I think having a board to write on is invaluable for studying mathematics.
Do you have any study tips to share?
I’m a big fan of taking a break when you need to. I like things like going for a run/walk to reset the mind so you can come back fresh. Also coffee is great.",0,26,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2687960587999881/

• Caption of the week. The sports committee post an iconic sporting photo and you need to come up with a funny caption in the form of a comment. The comment with the most likes wins. Win the most to rise up the leaderboard
• Post your own highlights. We will create a theme each week (e.g. after the siren wins) and you post your favourite video
• Post your own workout routine. Post a list of what exercises you do in your workout now that the gym is closed. Hopefully this will help people share good ideas and allow them to incorporate more into their own workout
• At home gym equipment. Post photos about how you can create at home gym equipment from everyday items in new and creative ways
• Anything sport related. If you want to post something about sport then do it

"Friday, 3 April 2020 at 6:47 pm",Aidan Fryer,"TL;DR Join the Fenner Strava Group below
G’Day Fenner,
Have you been doing more running, walking or cycling now that you can’t do any of your usual activities? Have you always done loads of that anyway? Well you might want to think about getting Strava. It’s a social media platform used to record physical activity, particularly running, walking and cycling. It shows you all sorts of nifty details like where you went on a map, your pace, the height of the hills you climbed and more. Personally, my favourite feature it it’s route planner. It’s a super detailed map showing you all the trails and paths you can take in your area. The best bit is that it actually shows all the paths, unlike google maps meaning if you have a large nature reserve near your house you’ll now be able to know exactly where to go.
Strava can also be a great way to motivate you to improve or run and cycle more. It supports running, cycling, walking, hiking, canoeing, crossfit, e-bike ride, elliptical, kayaking, rock climbing, stand up paddle boarding, surfing, weight training, yoga and loads of other activities. There is something to suit everyone and their favourite type of exercise. All you need to do to record activities is take your phone with you or bring a GPS watch and press record for whatever activity you do.
Other cool features include being able to attach photos to your activity. Did you cycle to a really picturesque location? Take a photo and show it off to everyone. Or perhaps you are more gifted with your mouth than with your legs. If you like talking complete nonsense, there’s plenty of space for that in the group discussion as well. Strava has something for just about everyone.
It’s also a good way to see what other people at Fenner are doing. That’s where this group comes in. In your normal strava news feed you can only see the activities of people who you follow. But with the Fenner Hall group, you can switch feeds to see the activities of everyone at Fenner. It’s a small way to connect with the Fenner community while we are apart but I’m sure it’s one that many people will value.
If you don’t want to share your activities but you still want to see what others are doing that’s okay too, you are able to change the privacy settings for each individual activity. You can make them completely private, only visible to your followers or visible to everyone.
Many people in the Fenner Inward Bound (IB) community already use strava regularly. Each year we make a Strava group for them. However as I’m sure you can imagine, there are some very competitive and fit runners in there which turns a lot of people away. This Fenner Hall group is separate to the IB group and you don’t have to smash yourself on a massive 9 or 10km run just to fit in. It’s perfectly okay just to record a walk around the corner or up the street.
If you are interested, click the link below, make an account and get involved! And if you have any questions, just send me a message and I’ll be happy to help.

There are now strong recommendations that every person keeps a contact diary. 
What this involves is keeping a record of who you have been in contact with, when and where. You can do this as a physical diary or as a record kept in your phone (eg. in your notes app). As we have sign in sheets in place, you do not need to do this for people you interact with in Fenner's common spaces, however, you should be doing this for any other interactions such as hanging out with a friend or seeing someone outside of Fenner.
Once you have it set up, it literally only takes a few seconds to record each interaction, with the option of adding an emoji for extra flavour! For example:
26/3, 8pm, Stu, Mandalay Bus 😋
27/3, 10am, Jake, Jake's room 🎮
27/3, 1pm, Maddy, Kebaba 🍟
The purpose of this is to be able to prevent and track community transmission of COVID-19 should a case occur at ANU. One of the major problems in places like Sydney is not being able to track the spread of the virus. Having this in place will make Fenner Hall and ANU a much safer place for everyone. This may seem extreme to you, as with many  of the other measures that are being put in place, but these are extreme times and we all need to be taking this seriously for the safety of everyone around us as well as ourselves.
Stay safe and if you have any questions about keeping a contact diary please comment them below ❤️",8,51,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2638338909628716/

No tldr, y’all have to read the entire thing
Hi everyone,
IMPORTANT HYGIENE INFO
One of the key messages that the Government and Department of Health keep re-iterating is the importance of hygiene in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
COVID-19 spreads though close contact with infectious persons via droplets from a cough or a sneeze and by touching contaminated surfaces that may have fluids on it.
In order to protect yourself and the Fenner Community, strict hygiene measures are an imperative.
Good respiratory hygiene includes:
- covering mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing or coughing
- coughing into your elbow
- disposing of rubbish and tissues appropriately
- washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds
- wiping down surfaces you are regularly in contact with (i.e. kitchens etc.)
- carry your own pen (don’t rely on others to lend you their property)
- do not share drink bottles, cutlery or the like
- flush the toilet
- don’t leave dirt, mess around
- don’t touch your face, mouth, pick your nose etc.
A lot of this is common sense and we would hope that you have good personal hygiene living in a communal space as it is. But now is more important than ever to keep yourself and your space clean and tidy.
We share toilets, kitchens and common spaces. I’m sure many of you have experienced entering one of these areas and seeing something grotty. This is just not on. We cannot continue living in a dirty unhygienic environment and we cannot ignore the importance of washing hands and not coughing on one another.
Please note: WHILST IT IS HARD TO FORCE YOU TO BE HYGIENIC, IF IT SEEMS PEOPLE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THESE GUIDELINES AND ARE CAUGHT NOT FOLLOWING PERSONAL HYGIENE PRACTICES THERE WILL BE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES
WASH YOUR HANDS YOU DETTY PIGS

No TLDR, please read the entire thing.

Hi all,

The Kitchens aren’t the only place where you need to observe restrictions. ALL Common Areas have restrictions in place.

These restrictions are in place to protect our community and we want you to do your part to achieve that. Therefore, we ask you to follow these rules:
1.  Sign-in every time you enter a common space
2.  Adhere to the 1.5m physical distancing rule
3.  Use hand-sanitiser frequently
4.  Kitchenettes are to only be used by residents who live on that floor (S3 and S4 are exempt from this rule)
5.  Kitchenettes cannot be used for large gatherings or partying, they are too small to maintain physical distancing
6.  Your own room should only have 2 people in it at a time
7.  Follow a common room's occupancy limit:
Floor Kitchenettes: 6 (60 minute limit)
Frank Fenner: 25
Computer Room: 1 person per computer
TV Room: 25
Study Booths on level 2: 4 per booth
Piano Space: 5
Warren Café: 25
Warren Games Area: 25
·  All common areas have a 2-hour limit.
·  Wait 2 hours before coming back.
·  Kitchens have a 45-minute limit, did you read the previous post?

It may seem cumbersome and pointless to sign in every time you enter a space but, in the event residents do come into contact with COVID-19 these sign-in sheets will be the FIRST line of defence in minimising and tracing it’s spread. Fenner has a number of residents who are immune compromised, by signing in EVERY TIME it will especially help us protect these members of our community. Signing in is not necessary if you are walking through a common space or quickly grabbing a coffee or food from the Warren and leaving. If you sit or stay for a while, sign the sheet!

Physical distancing also may seem annoying, but it’s an incredibly effective method in ensuring people feel safe during this time of vulnerability. There is NO excuse for refusing to distance yourself from others in common spaces. To help with this, if you need to gather in groups, we ask you to gather in physically distanced groups of no more than 10 people.

Finally, we get that it’s hard to keep track of how many people are in a common space at once. Restricting the number of people in a room will help everyone remain 1.5m apart. If you see that that a room has reached its limit, please don’t enter it with the intention of staying. The room limits have been carefully calibrated to ensure people can physically distance. Leadership have deliberately reduced the number of seats to help everyone follow this.

Please note: THESE MEASURES MAY BE STRICLY ENFORCED IF THEY AREN’T SELF-REGULATED. SRs don’t want to have to push for enforcement, but if you continue to ignore these rules and directions it is will be the only way to protect people in our community. Nerilee has been inundated with e-mails from people who don’t feel safe living at Fenner because people are ignoring these measures. Think how your actions could be potentially putting people at risk.

The SRs.",1,27,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2634486593347281/

Read Everything below before conducting the survey

If you are struggling financially as a result of COVID-19 please take some time to fill out this survey I have created. This is specifically for those of you who may be experiencing financial difficulty as a result of job-loss, shift-loss and/or isolation. All information provided in the survey is confidential and only accessed by staff.

Residential experience are trying to assess the financial burden placed on students and want to find ways to assist. This is a productive measure they are taking and they understand the difficult situation for students so please be respectful and patient. There is absolutely no confirmed outcome at the moment with regards to financial assistance/reduced rent so at this rate DO NOT jump to the conclusion that there will be.

Finally, I need you all to understand this very carefully. This is an honesty based system and I cannot stress how much you need to make sure you put down accurate information. If you attempt to provide any false information for potential personal gain THIS WILL negatively impact the outcome for residents who are genuinely struggling and need support. It is an incredibly selfish and disgusting thing to do and if this is found out there will be serious disciplinary action from either Fenner Hall or the ANU.

You may have noticed there are less chairs around and there is green tape on the floor and tables. This is because we really want to enforce social distancing to keep all our ressies as safe as possible!
In the warren and transition space:
There are less chairs and green tape has been placed on the tables to indicate where the chairs should be and should stay.
Please don’t move these chairs around!!
Kitchen:
The chairs have been removed from the prep tables in the kitchen because we don’t want anyone sitting at the tables to eat (you can still prepare food at those tables). Green tape has also been placed on the floor in front of the burners to indicate how many people should be using the kitchen benches at once.
The number of people allowed at each table has been updated to only 3 people (there is more tape to indicate this). As a basic rule just keep 1.5m apart.
Update (balcony):
There should only be three people to a table on the balcony (follow the green tape)!!
Please practice social distancing so that we can all keep each other safe ❤️",2,35,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2634193046709969/

 No tldr, please read the entire thing.
(Edited to update balcony tables to being 3 people only)
Hi All

Many of you, and I hope that all of you have read the email sent by Hannah, our Residential Wellbeing Co-ordinator (sent 17/3/20, 5.25pm). There are incredibly important protocols that MUST be followed. 

One of these is the responsible use of the KITCHEN areas.   You will know that each bay has a name (see the rangehoods above each bay). The kitchen how has a limit on how many people can be there at once. Each bay has its own limits of number of people who can use them. These are repeated below:

Parrot - 4 max
Gecko - 13 max
Moth - 12 max
Devil - 14 max
Frog - 12 max

Balcony - 3 per table max
BBQ - 1 per hot plate
Dining Area - 3 per table max

BEFORE you enter the kitchen, you MUST SIGN IN using the sheets provided. You may only spend 45 MINUTES in the kitchen. The only exception to this is if you go to grab something out of your fridge/freezer/cupboard and leave. You must sign out when you LEAVE. 

HAND HYGIENE. JUST DO IT. Don't be an egg, WASH YOUR HANDS and SAVE LIVES. 

You CANNOT eat in the kitchen. 
You must CLEAN UP after yourself. Wipe down benches/tables. SINKS ARE NOT SIEVES - remove your food from the drains. Take your food and other items. 
Try to eat in your own room. If you eat in a common area, adhere to 1.5m distancing as noted by the green tape placed by FRC and SRs. 
Do you have to be in the kitchen? Can you meal prep and instead ""heat and eat""  and take your meals in your room? Can you move your breakfast to your room? These all reduce the number of people in the kitchen and KEEPS EVERYONE SAFE. 

Please note: THESE MAY BE ENFORCED AND THERE WILL BE A POTENTIAL FOR CONSEQUENCES. We know this post may sound harsh, but we are trying to make sure that everyone is as safe as possible.

  The SRs",0,24,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2634236910038916/

Yeah no tldr, please read the entire thing.

Hi All

The SR team and I are going to be making a handful of incredibly important posts over the course of the next day/s regarding individual responsibility and we expect that you will take them seriously. We understand you are all concerned with certain developments and we want to let you know that more developments as such may likely occur. Nerilee, Hannah and the CCs are working tirelessly to respond and mitigate all that is occurring so please be respectful and understand this is incredibly tough on them as well.

I would encourage you to read Nerilee’s most recent email (sent approx. 18:13 yesterday), especially regarding ‘returning to the hall’ as this may answer a lot of questions. Feel free to talk to your respective SR if you still have further inquiries and we shall do our best to respond. Note, just because we are Senior Residents, does not mean we have all the answers, we will try hard to find out certain things, but please understand we may not know them now.

Without frightening anyone, the COVID-19 situation is evolving and evolving rapidly. A residential college is unfortunately not the ideal environment to be placed in with a virus going rampant globally. As a result, just because you may personally not be worried or affected DOES NOT MEAN there are no residents here who are particularly vulnerable.  We all need to be on board with physical distancing, cleanliness, isolating, minimizing travel, signing in/out and many risk minimization techniques with which you will hear about today. If you are deliberately going to ignore policies and recommendations in place you are subsequently placing our entire community at risk. If there is a genuine issue you are facing, or some constructive criticism, we are more than welcome to take this on board.

The next handful of posts coming from SRs are going to be about how we all need to act around the hall. Please note: THESE MAY BE ENFORCED AND THERE WILL BE A POTENTIAL FOR CONSEQUENCES. More news will come regarding policies (such as issues of rent/financial implications, ANU-wide policies and other potential restrictions). I know this post may sound harsh, but we are trying to make sure that everyone is as safe as possible.

"Monday, 23 March 2020 at 7:22 pm",,"Hey everyone, this is going to be a bit of a long post, but please take the time to read it (we should all have quite a bit of free time at the moment)!  

Firstly, I hope you are all doing well in what is a super strange and difficult time. We are facing a situation that is completely new to us, and it’s hard to know how to respond. As a community, it is super important that we continue to look after ourselves and each other, and this is a responsibility that we must take seriously. Send your friends a message and see how they are doing, and reach out to those around you (SRs, family, friends, professionals) if you are struggling yourself. It is also important to understand that we will all be impacted by this in different ways, and deal with it differently. Some of you might not be worried, while others might be quite upset, and that is ok. Empathy is hugely important at the moment, so try to understand why others may be feeling the way they do and respect that.  

So, what can we do? There are a few simple things that you would have all heard about, and that we can all do to limit the impact of this virus upon our lives. But it takes a unified and concerted effort. We must be all in. 

1. Social distancing - there has been a lot said about this, and I understand that living with almost 400 other people unsurprisingly makes this difficult. But we have to try. As has been said in emails (which I hope you are all checking!), study in your room, eat away from other people/in your room, limit non-essential social activity, and keep a distance of 1.5m! This doesn’t mean stop talking to your friends or don’t go outside, it just means we have to be creative. FaceTime, Netflix Party (not a physical party, it’s online), join a minecraft server (Jake McCall), head outside and enjoy the fantastic weather and go for a walk. It’s not easy, but we can do it. The hard part is changing routine. We can no longer do what we have previously. If you have something on (that involves seeing other people), work out if it really is a necessity, and if it’s not, stay home. It’s hard, but we are the only ones who can make this work. The situation isn’t going to change unless we change.  

2. Social distancing again - seriously, it’s that important. 

3. Wash your hands/don’t touch your face - make sure you are constantly washing/sanitizing your hands any time you are touching anything! On top of this, avoid touching your face as much as possible!   

This is a big change. It’s hard, and there is no easy way about it, but we have to do it. If not for yourself, do it for those around you. Do it for the people who are at risk that you might not know about. Those with suppressed immunity, chronic illness, disability, asthma - the list continues, but it is not just the elderly. These people are at Fenner, and you may not know them, but you can support them. We are young, but we are not invincible. Now more than ever, we need to look beyond our own health (especially if we are in the privileged position of being young and healthy) and act for others who are not as fortunate. Actions have consequences, and we have the opportunity to have a positive impact on limiting the spread of this virus.   Our unofficial motto is ‘Fenner looks after Fenner’, and in my experience, this is true. So embody those words in your actions and think of your community, and Fenner will continue to be the incredible place that it is. ❤️",4,66,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2630200513775889/

JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS
We are all conscious that our health systems are under a lot of pressure around the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. Canberra Health Services (CHS) works closely with ANU and they have reached out to ask for our help from staff and students to undertake casual employment.
This is a great opportunity to give back to the community during this time of need. This call is for employment to boost capacity of their workforce rather than volunteering as some may have done previously, and Canberra Health Services will provide onboarding and employment arrangements.

Hello all, I don’t mean to excite you all to death, but the time has come to begin creating FENNER REVUE. At this stage, the show must go on and we are gonna get this bread. 

So, what is Fenner Revue? 
Well, essentially it is a skit comedy show written, performed and produced by the people of Fenner. Think Monty Python (but way funnier and more applicable to college life). Although we can’t be certain when the show will be held, it is time to begin writing the script. This year, Rowena McPhee will be your blessed producer and I will be your director!
Have you ever lived at Fenner? Have you ever experienced a thought or feeling? Have you ever existed as a person? If you said yes to any of these questions, you are perfect as a Fenner Revue writer! No experience is required and every person is welcome. We will be holding a small get together (probably live-streamed as well for anyone not comfy attending), just to give some tips for skit/song writing and to explain more about Fenner Revue. Please join this group if you are interested in writing for the show. Please also join this group if you are hoping to audition! 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/489399331739235

We will keep you updated when auditions will be held!

"Monday, 16 March 2020 at 6:03 pm",,"*FRC Meeting Update*
Good evening, I would like to thank everyone who attend the FRC meeting last night. Your concerns, queries and ideas were incredibly valuable and have been passed onto the appropriate bodies.
Advocacy:
The advocacy submissions have been shared with Nerilee and the property manager and they will provide a response soon and have taken on board what has been brought to their attention. COVID-19:
Regarding Fenner Hall’s response to the new regulations due to COVID-19, an in-depth summary is being worked on by Nerilee and the rest of the Fenner Hall team. This will be released tomorrow with the most up-to-date information we currently have. Please check your university emails for this as that is where all formal communication will be sent.
Paper towels, sanitizer and more:
Your concerns about hygiene and resources provided by Fenner Hall Administration have been heard and understood. The property manager is in the process of sourcing more communal hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray is also being investigated. However, I really need to stress this; as hygiene standards are heightened to prevent the spread of this disease it is not possible to provide enough hand sanitizer for 449 students that will rightly re-apply multiple times a day. This goes for paper towel, sanitizer, spray-and-wipe and other protective measures. The high level of consumption paired with the difficulty of sourcing these in-demand resources means that it isn’t possible to supply enough.
We do all live together, but just as we have our own dishwashing liquid, and toothpaste, there is also an expected personal responsibility for hygiene. The Fenner Team is encouraging residents to take your health into your own hands (pun intended) and have your own personal supplies. Further to this, although hand sanitizer is useful, soap and water is the most effective method as it can break down the fats on your skin, without drying them out as much.
Suggested measures:
- A small bottle of hand sanitizer that you can carry with you
- A bar of soap next to your sink in your room
- A small hand towel you can take to the bathroom with you to dry your hands
- Using elbows to open doors
- Using the bottom of a shirt or a sleeve to cover your hand when pressing buttons such as for the elevators
- Having a bottle of spray and wipe in your kitchen cupboard
- Having a personal roll of paper towel
If anyone thinks of any other savvy solutions for hygiene hacks, please share them!
I hope this clears up a few things, please continue to use the advocacy form for any concerns, questions or feedback as new systems are implemented around the hall. Thank you for your understanding and check your university emails tomorrow for more information.",4,18,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2614400058689268/

Arts Revue audition sign ups are open!!! Do you like acting? Singing? Dancing? Comedy? Not taking yourself too seriously? Maybe you have done none of these things before or maybe you’re an expert - it doesn’t matter as long as you are enthusiastic and willing to give things a go!
So what is a revue? It’s a completely original show written by us, the students, made up of skits, songs and dances.
Why should you sign up? It’s a really good time. You get to meet a bunch of awesome people and make some great friends from all over the uni. You also learn a lot and try new things.
Who can sign up? Anyone!! Doesn’t matter if you don’t do an arts degree (seriously, half of the exec isn’t doing an arts degree).
What’s involved in the audition? You perform a short skit with a partner, you get taught a short dance as a group, you sing along to a song as a group. Also we get you to send in a short piece of writing (doesn’t have to be good we’re just looking to see that you’re willing to give writing a go). It’s under two hours and the audition itself is a fun time.
I'm producing it this year and whether you experienced me dancing in your face during market day or know me in any other capacity you'll know we are super chill and it is not a high pressure environment. I did it as a first year last year and it was the one of the best experiences I had (I'm back for more!!!), and if you're a later year this is just what you need to spice up uni again (just ask arts master Susan or president Erin). If you're unsure or on the fence say fuck it sign up and I promise you will not regret it!!
Fill out the sign up for auditions in weeks 3 and 4: https://forms.gle/X17dbersJ6rQbReA6",1,9,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2585493534913254/

Hola!! As you have seen an email has been sent out with further info about the position but here is a brief overview:
Weekly Wednesday Tea Nights in the Warren, good vibes, preparing all the food and choosing what we put out each week.
Bar Nights/Mixers pretty much 1 every 2 weeks. We begin set-up around 5pm for a 7:30/8pm start. We are sober during the events but we get to choose who we mix with, what the theme is, decor, food, etc. A lot of fun and you get to see everyone enjoy all the hardworking you put in to each event. You get to put your voice and view into action, in making Fenner and its events even greater.
Mid-Year Ball is probably our biggest event. A lot of work -blood, sweat and tears- is put into this event especially. We organise it all! Venue, Catering, Transport, THEME, Pricing. EVERYTHING. This is THE event of the year in the Fenner Calendar! (and we get free tickets bc ya know - organisers privilege)
MX Fenner is basically a talent show gone very wrong. We choose the run of the evening, the categories and vet all the performances! Yet another awesome night that every Fenner resize looks forward to! We are required to attend FRC meetings every Sunday which gives you a chance to know what is going around the hall and represent the community by bringing up issues or ideas that you have heard. We also have weekly social meetings in which we check and set the plan for the following weeks (these may be longer come MYB season teehee - coffee provided I promise!)
Commitment wise, weekly tea nights and meetings may take up to 3 hours a week, and then bar nights or mixers every other week add about 6 hours. This ramps up in second set with having to organise Mid-Year and MX but still a manageable load. If you cannot make the times I am available flick me a message and we can organise a time:
Thursday: 1-2 in the Warren
Friday: 12-1 in the Warren
Saturday 2-4 I have a warren shift
Feel free to ask me any questions you may have. And remember to hand the forms in by 6pm on Saturday either to reception or one of the CCs Jen or Rowena.
See you soon and good luck!! <3 <3",0,10,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2604247509704523/

Before colonisation, this nation was booming and glorious, filled with hundreds of language groups. Nowadays, over 90% of our languages are extinct or endangered, which is heartbreaking. Lots of work is underway to try and save these languages, but with colonisation and the forced stealing of Aboriginal children, languages weren't passed down between generations. In missionaries, children were not allowed to speak anything other than english, lest they be punished. Once stolen, most children never saw their families again and thus could not learn their languages.

"Friday, 6 March 2020 at 2:47 pm",Angus Brooks,"Hi everyone, it’s warren hour. As my partner in crime Angus Brooks isn’t here (R.I.P), I’m going a bit rogue and will be ranking every warren soft drink. I don’t believe in objectivity except for in this situation where I am objectively right. Come by to argue with me (and dan is here too but doesn’t endorse this list)
1. PASITO
The only thing that trumps pasito is orange and mango mineral water and we don’t have that at the warren so here we are. Passion fruit is just undeniably in the top three flavours of all time and a butter chicken fizzy drink just wouldn’t work. I fucking love Pasito. Also it’s the “most Phi soft drink” -Sabine
2. SOLO
Thank fuck the Warren has solo because let’s be real, it’s leagues better than Lift. I strongly debated putting this as number 1 so you know it’s good. Nothing can beat that lemon taste and Angus is seen with cans of solo as mixer every Thursday night without fail and I wanted to honour his memory. Also, yellow is the best colour
3. SCHWEPPES LEMONADE
It’s so fucking refreshing holy shit. Easily the soft drink that hits the hardest and sometimes you just really need that. It’s the best lemonade and I’m not afraid to say it
4. KIRKS LEMONADE
it’s just worse Schweppes
5. KIRKS GINGER BEER
I was actually convinced I hated ginger beer until this summer when I was pressed on what to mix whisky with and we met again- and honestly, I’m disappointed I deprived myself for years. I owe all ginger beers/ales an apology for poor judgement and also for not knowing the difference.
6. DIET SPRITE
it’s just worse sprite. Sprite could’ve gotten the #4 place if the Warren hadn’t had the diet option but alas. However I do understand the logic as we probably need a diet option and non diet option and Schweppes probably doesn’t provide that because their lemonade is untouchable
7. ALL OF THE COKES
Listen. I don’t like coke. I have never tried Vanilla Coke or coke no sugar. I’m not going to lie, the only reason I allow it into my body is because of dark liquors and I’d rather just have ginger ale or even just straight. It’s just so... much? And everything else (save the really bad ones) are better? It’s just so mediocre
8. CREAMING SODA
Why is it like that???
9. SUNKIST
First of all, it’s so obviously inferior to Fanta. But second of all, who wants 375ml of any orange soft drink?? Sometimes, I won’t lie, a little sip is satisfying, but any time I think I want it and order it I find myself disappointed and wishing I had stuck to the status quo.",1,19,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2593460304116577/

Did any of you notice photographers floating around during O-Week? Did you think it seemed like a cool thing to do? If you answered yes, then perhaps you'd like to take photos around Fenner too. Events include bar nights, sports games and many more. If you are keen, join the group below. 
Unfortunately, iPhone cameras will not cut it and you'll need your own camera.
Many of them are paid, although others will be volunteer work, just keep an eye out in the group to see.

While you may be a little dusty from last night, or just wanting to avoid the rain, head over to Willows at 2pm to show some support for your fellow residents as they battle the elements. Plus there is undercover seating, so no excuse!!!
I can assure you that you will not be disappointed, and while it may be wet, you will still be able to see the tears in the eyes of the Johns players when we send them back to Daley road defeated (not before congratulating them on their effort though - disc is all about being a good sport) 🐰🤩🏆",2,18,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2589108311218443/

"Saturday, 29 February 2020 at 5:37 pm",,"TLDR : volunteering opportunity tutoring refugees and migrants in Civic ✏️📖🧠
Hey guys! Just wanted to give you a quick run down on a volunteer program I'm running this year. 
🌿 What?
An opportunity to volunteer to tutor refugees and migrants in Canberra! Most people just need help with English language skills and editing, and everyone at the MYS and those I’ve tutored have been lovely.
☘️Why?
So many reasons! Tutoring is really rewarding and a great way to give back to the Canberra community by sharing skills, and can also help you develop your own. I also found it helped me get out of the ‘ANU bubble’ and meet other people with diverse life experiences and opinions from all around Canberra. Volunteer tutoring can also be a good step towards paid tutoring work or just a good reference on your resumé.
🐢Who?
This is open to anyone (although we will be conducting interviews to check that people will be a good fit!). The only requirements are a desire to teach and a Working With Vulnerable People card, for which I can help you apply (and is free for volunteers).
🐛When?
Tutoring commitments are 1.5 hours per week, from 4 - 5.30pm, and the days are flexible (usually Monday, Wednesday, Thursday). Starting very soon!
🍃Where?
The Theo Notaras Multicultural Centre, 2/180 London Cct Canberra. Only a 15 min walk from Fenner.
🌱Now what?
So you want to be involved? That’s fantastic! Please comment on this post and I will add you to the group for further info and training. ☺️🌼🌟",3,13,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2581184418677499/

G'Day Fenner,
I hope your start to Uni has been happy and productive. There's not too much new information to cover this week but you'll still find all you need to get involved here.
Training has now begun for each sport: touch, road relay, volleyball and Frisbee.
Games are starting this week for frisbee. They are all on Fellows oval and are at 2pm on Wednesday and 4pm on Thursday. Games for other sports start later in the term
If you would like to get involved, join the relevant Facebook group below and keep an eye out for when training times are
Match Reports
Interhall Lawn Bowls was yesterday and our six representatives stood tall in the face of everything from bustling crowds to packs of Burgmann boys in suits. Luckily for Burgmann we didn't get to play them and played against Griffin instead. We performed really well, with Maya Berg driving the action. Before long, a good team effort saw the scores level at 3 all in a best of 7 game. Strong work early in the final set from Alex Matters led us to believe we had it in the bag. However on the last shot, our closest ball was knocked away resulting in a loss for Fenner! Since it was a knockout tournament, this was our only game. Well done to all who played!

"Monday, 2 March 2020 at 12:25 pm",,"Hello friends and welcome to another Indigenous hour, featuring music only from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stars! 

In the spirit of Mardi Gras and pride in general, I would like to talk about gender among our people. 

Many of you know about the strict gender and sexuality expectations that come on the boats accompanying colonisation, but since well before colonisation our people were accepting of our LGBTQIA+ mob. Aboriginal people have a term referring to our trans mob. We call our trans men brotherboys and our trans women sistergirls. This is a term of love and acceptance, as we call people we love brother and sister, regardless of familial relations. 
Although many language groups had gender roles, these roles were flexible when people identified with another gender. Brie and Rosalie from Brothers and Sisters NT said “Sistergirls have always been here, before even Europeans came along. There were always transgendered people in the community.... Back then… they would automatically see that sistergirl, that’s not a boy, she’s a girl. So that sistergirl would go with the women and do women’s dancing and ceremony and all that sort of stuff.”
“So for sistergirls, it’s always been in our culture, and we have the role as a woman. We go hunting with the women. We go sitting with the women and talking with the women, and grow up and have nieces and nephews like they’re our own children.”

I don't mean to sound aggressive but transphobia came with colonisation. Nowadays, many mob don't understand their LGBTQIA+ family, which arises from the last 250 years of oppression and control.

I think it is bad for health and a safety concern. They should be replaced or left out of the oven altogether. I experienced it myself and I wonder if I would be affected from the inhalation when opening the heated oven or consuming the food in the oven that is filled with smoke and fumes.,3,2,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2581614208634520/

Hi everyone, I just wanted to pass on a message from a collective member about an experience they had yesterday. They wanted to let everyone know about this man who was outside 7/11 Barry Drive on his bike, and was harassing women by refusing to leave them alone until they agreed to go on a date with him or gave him their number/add him on Facebook by cycling alongside them while they walked. They also saw this person doing this to another person after she had left him.
If you have had any experiences with this person, or seen him doing the same thing, please let me know by emailing me at sa.womens@anu.edu.au. I have already emailed ANU Security about it and they will hopefully send a patrol down and follow up accordingly (I will update as I get updates).

This week I will be talking about the Acknowledgements of Country and a Welcome to Country.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY
An Acknowledgement of Country is an opportunity to pay our respects to the Nation/Language Group that we are on. Anyone can do an acknowledgement, you do not have to be Indigenous. They do not have to be complex and can simply extend respect and recognise the language group as the traditional custodians. A simple one that I use for informal events is:
""I would like to acknowledge the land we meet on today, the ancestral/traditional lands of the .... People. I would like to pay my respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging and extend that respect to any Indigenous people present""
Feel free to use this and do not be afraid to do an acknowledgement yourself. Many of us would prefer you try a small one nervously than point us out in a crowd and ask us to do it, as your efforts show your respect. If you're running an event and want an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander to come in and do an acknowledgement, don't be surprised if they ask for a little payment as they're coming in during their own time and writing something for something you can do yourself!
WELCOME TO COUNTRY
A Welcome can only be done by someone of the language group. I cannot do a Welcome in Canberra, as I am not Ngunnawal or Ngambri. It essentially welcomes all visitors and attendees of an event to the land. This can sometimes be accompanied by a smoking ceremony and other additions. Traditionally, in pre-colonial times, an individual/group would have to receive permission to cross into another mob's land. This permission would offer safety, both physically and spiritually and would an important custom. When on a different Country, you were expected to follow the customs of the mob you were welcomed by.",0,39,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2570522346410373/

"Sunday, 23 February 2020 at 9:11 pm",,"WEEKLY SPORT UPDATE
Hey Fenner,
I hope you have all had a safe and fun O-Week and are ready to get right into classes tomorrow. If you are interested in the world of sport and are keen to get involved, read on.
Training for term 1 sports starts tomorrow with Disc, Road Relay, Volleyball and Touch Football (Rugby League) all on offer. Fenner sports are run by the Interhall Sports Organisation so you might hear this called ISO sport a fair bit. It is really social and everyone who comes along is sure to have a fun time. Beginners are welcome and encouraged to attend whatever sports they like. If you would like to get involved, you should join the Facebook group for each sport, which I'll post in the comments, and keep an eye out for training times. Training starts this week with the first games in week 2.
Games and trainings are often during the week and will clash with your classes. This is okay, don't feel like you can't play a sport at all just because one or two of your classes clash. Even if you can only make the occasional game, you are still welcome.
Disc (mixed)
Training: Monday 2pm, Saturday 6pm
Games: Weeks 2-5
Touch (Men's and Women's)
Training: TBC but probably any of Tuesday 3pm, Saturday 6pm and Sunday 6pm
Games (Men's and Women's): Week 4
Road Relay
Training: Tuesday 6pm, Saturday 8am
Competition: One day on Sunday at the end of week 5
Men's Volleyball
Training: Thursday 10am, Sunday 10am
Games: weeks 3 and 4
Women's Volleyball
Trainings: Tuesday 10am, Friday 12pm
Games: weeks 3 and 4
Lawn Bowls
This is a one off 'social tier' sport on Saturday at 5pm. Come along for chill vibes and good times. We will post about this in the group.
For all of these training sessions. Come to the Fenner front foyer to walk over to the oval/court. Usually try to come down about 10 mins before the hour.
Most of the sports are fairly self-explanatory, but road relay is something unique to ANU (but still simple). Four male identifying residents and four female identifying residents run a relay. On a road. Two of each gender run 1.5km and two run 3km. The race starts just outside Johns College, takes you around campus and finishes in the same place.
First Year Reps
The Fenner Residents' committee is made up of three main sub-committees, the arts, social and sports. Each of those committees has one first year rep position only open to first year residents. The sports committee also has one normal sports rep position open to everybody, first year or not, meaning there will be an upcoming election for TWO sports reps. If you are interested, make sure to read the email you will receive from admin to your uni email address around about week 2 explaining the nomination process. I will post a list of the roles you will have to do in the coming days, so keep an eye out.
If you are interested in watching or attending some professional sports, read on. The Women's T20 world cup in Cricket has started and it's being played here in Australia. There are even some games happening in Canberra. The Men's team are over in South Africa and are playing tonight in a T20. They smashed them the other day and Ashton Agar even took a hat-trick. The AFLW has started too and you can watch games on the AFL website, or Channel 7. The Super Rugby (union) season has kicked off early this year and is in full swing. The women's comp is also going full steam ahead and you can watch games on both Foxtel or Kayo.
I've also posted the slides from today's sports and arts info session if you would like to look over them again. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to leave a comment below, send me a message or come have a chat.",7,12,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2569161369879804/

🤩🥏JOIN FENNER DISC - GOOD TIMES AND GREAT CLASSIC HITS 🥏🤩
Hi, I just have a quick survey for residents to complete. You are the 108793rd visitor to this page and will win a huge prize following completion of the survey below!
Please answer the following yes or no questions, and do so as truthfully as possible:
Do you like Fenner?
Do you like sport?
Do you like having fun?
Do you think I am capable of coaching a sport that I know very little about?
Do you like listening to music?
Do you like eating?
Have you heard of piecost?
Are plugged sinks in the Fenner kitchens gross?
Should you continue to use a plugged sink without cleaning it out?
If you answered yes, no or anything else to any of these questions, then disc is the sport for you. Although I may not know what I am doing, I am lucky to have Alex Matters by my side to actually teach people disc-related stuff. What I do know though is how to have a good time, so join the page and get ready for the most social sport in the Fenner calendar. Good times and big plays are guaranteed! (No experience required - open to everyone!)",3,13,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2560144284114846/

Ultimate sizzle – Wednesday 5pm. Come and learn the basics of ultimate disc and just have a casual throw around. Then come back to Fenner and enjoy a free BBQ with vego options
Kicking bas and downing snags – Thursday 5pm. Come down to south oval for a social AFL Kick to kick. Then come back to Fenner for another BBQ
Backyard Cricket – Saturday 4pm. On Fellows Oval. It’s super beginner friendly and played with a tennis ball so you won’t need any protective equipment. For more advanced players you can expect a home-made swing king
Sports and Arts information session – Sunday 3pm. To learn everything about what sports we offer, how to get involved, inward bound and first year rep elections, make sure to come along to this in the TV room.",2,21,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2554004744728800/

"Sunday, 16 February 2020 at 9:39 am",Phoebe Denham,"Hello Fenner!
Just a few things to say about clubs and club registration this year.
For those of you unaware, the FRC has it’s own Clubs Scheme where residents are invited to set up and participate in any clubs that take their interest. There is usually a huge variety of clubs, and everybody is invited to all of them! Some traditional Fenner clubs include 500 Club, Bootcamp, and Cooking Skills (each of which has already planned to be run again this year). Most clubs meet on a weekly basis. FRC-registered clubs are entitled to a little funding to purchase resources, but more importantly… they get snacks every time they meet!
If you would like to register a club, please fill out this form! Previously existing clubs do need to be registered again each year.
Each club has a coordinator who is responsible for ensuring the club runs smoothly and inclusively, and keeps track of the club’s budget. Clubs may have more than one coordinator – just put both/all coordinators’ names in the form please!
The overall aim of the Clubs Scheme is to promote inclusivity and ensure all residents are afforded an equal opportunity to engage in activities within the hall.
Please feel free to comment any questions, or come find me and ask!
Looking forward to seeing some great clubs this year <3",0,10,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2553178578144750/

On behalf of the musical exec team I am thrilled to announce the Fenner Hall Musical for 2020 - Young Frankenstein!
This musical comedy follows scientist Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced fronk-en-steen), the grandson of the infamous Dr Victor von Frankenstein, as he inherits the family estate in Transylvania and tries to avoid following in his grandfather's footsteps. 🧟‍♂️🧠
The Fenner musical is an awesome experience! No experience is required to become part of the cast and it is a wonderful way to learn new skills and make new friends!

Are you interested in coaching a sport in term 1? We are still looking for coaches for term 1 sports. In particular, we are short on Women's volleyball and Men's touch (Rugby League) coaches.
Two coaches are appointed to each sport and one of them will need to turn up to each training session and game. They get to choose when training is and get to run them. Training sessions run until the last game. So for touch, where games are played over 3 consecutive days in Week 4, there will be no training in week 5 or 6. Volleyball games are in week 3 and week 4. If you are interested then please fill out the form below.
If you have any questions feel free to send me a message over Facebook or come have a chat.
If you want to play any of the term 1 sports, more information will be coming out before training starts in week 1.",1,3,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2544905882305353/

"Sunday, 9 February 2020 at 10:32 pm",Senior Ressie Acadaca,"TLDR: SR (Academic) roles, upcoming O-week events and tips
Hi Fenner,
We are the Senior Residents (academic) for 2020. This means that as well as being Senior Residents we help to foster Fenner Hall's academic culture.
Essentially, we help residents to get the best academic experience they can through:
- running regular 'Study-Smash' study groups with available academic advice
- providing information on upcoming university-wide events
- helping with tutorial sign ups, timetabling and degree structuring
- offering study tips, tricks and snacks
ACADEMIC ALERT: TIPS FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
- Wattle opens tomorrow (tomorrow!!!!)- 9am 10th of February. This means that you should be able to view the courses you are enrolled in and see when tutorial/lab sign ups will be (make sure you set an alarm/diarise when these open so you can hopefully get the time slot you want!)
- Course enrolments are open. Double check with your degree requirements what courses you should be studying and if in doubt email the relevant ANU staff to check. The 2nd of March is the last day you can enrol in courses and the 31st of March is census date (but more on that closer to the day).
- Use the official ANU timetable to see what your weekly schedule looks like and when you have classes (hot tip: the unofficial ANU timetable planner can be useful- but make sure to cross check with the official one!)
- Attend the 'Afternoon with the Academics' event during O-week on the 19th of Feb to have drop-in consultations, and attend the 'Academic Scav Hunt' on the 21st of Feb to familiarise yourself with the ANU campus (more info on these events soon- keep your eyes out!)
- And finally, don't forget to ASK if you have any questions or queries at all! The start of the university year can be exciting, overwhelming, confusing and fun, and no question is too big, too small or too silly!- just ask your Senior Resident!

"Wednesday, 5 February 2020 at 6:54 pm",,"Hey Fenner,
Tonight is Wednesday. And that means it's bread night. The Fenner Residents committee (FRC) are bringing back leftover bread from the bakers delight store in Belconnen. We do this each week and leave bags of it on the tables in the Warren next to reception. Any fenner resident can come and get some. There are some rules though.
Breadiquette:
Only take 3 items of bread. There needs to be enough for everyone else
Line up. It will be chaos if everyone crowds around the Warren tables. Instead wait in line until the FRC member at the front says you can go get some bread
It takes a long time to bring in countless bags of bread from our fenner bus though. So we usually ask for you to volunteer to come to the turning circle behind fenner to help us carry it in. These people get to go first in line to get bread. They get the best bread like the raisin toast/fruit bread. If you would like to volunteer please come to the turning circle in 10 minutes.
Each week we also give you a meme. See below for a factual recount of biblical history.",2,14,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2529713447157930/

TL;DR: Don’t call the duty warden for anything to do with checkouts, accessing vacuums after 7pm, accessing Trolleys after 7pm or settling outstanding amounts at the office. Limit use of vacuums to 20 minutes, don’t store items in corridors for extended periods.
Hi all,
In the final days of contract just a few reminders (I am Duty warden for the last two nights btw)
1. Do not call the Warden for checkouts. Just slip the key through onto the front office desk. Do not call the Duty Warden for deposit reimbursement forms. I will not come down to hand them to you. These need to be collected during office hours And returned when you check out
2. No vacuum cleaners after 7:00 pm (it is usually a 6pm cut off but I will be lenient for the final days but don’t push it) you will have to cop the fine if you weren’t organised to do this before 7:00pm and you need to leave.
3. Limit use of vacuum cleaners to 20 minutes. It takes no longer than 10 minutes to vacuum a room and with only 1 working vacuum we really need to efficient. Don’t borrow it until you are absolutely ready to vacuum.
4. The Duty warden can not settle accounts or outstanding amounts at the office. So please do this during office hours. Don’t ring to do it.
5. Don’t store items in the hallway for extended periods and don’t leave things there. They will be moved if they are and no guarantees you will get them back. While you are actively moving is ok but otherwise items are stored in your room.
6. No Trolleys after 7pm. You need to be organised and move heavy items out of your room before 7pm even if you have a late night flight or departure. I suggest asking friends to help move things after 7pm. I had to do this myself for my own bookcase and fridge.

To the large group partying the Warren. Thank you so much for diligently moving down without being asked, I am very impressed and very appreciative of your efforts.
I would strongly suggest however that you all make an effort before leaving the area tonight to clean it up because the state it was in when I was on rounds is not going to make Nerilee very happy tomorrow if it remains like that. If Nerilee sees that tomorrow she is going to follow up with me and the Duty log and she might ask for names of people I saw in the Warren tonight if the warren is left in an unacceptable state like it is atm. Please don’t make me give names and respect the common space by cleaning it up after you are finished.

"Thursday, 14 November 2019 at 12:15 pm",,"TL;DR: Swap room cards during office hours or between 5-7pm with the Duty Warden. Duty Warden will be VERY strict on noise tonight. Please Call the DW if you need help, get locked or in case of an incident/emergency. Please make my life easy and celebrate/party responsibly.
Hi All. I am the Duty Warden tonight and I just wanted to pass on a few messages.
1. Red Room cards need to be swapped over for your new white cards in office hours if at all possible (you have all been sent an email about this). I recognize however due to work and other commitments this can be hard. With this in mind, I will be sitting in the front office area from 5pm-7pm tonight for you to collect cards. If you can't make it during the day today or at that time please email the front office to let them know they can inform me. If you ring me otherwise to collect the room card I will obviously help you get into your room and get your card but I will be really unimpressed and will make a specific note of the lockout in the duty log (you will all have had plenty of time by that point to collect the cards).
2. This is notoriously a very busy and stressful night for the Duty warden as many people have finished exams and obviously want to party. While I encourage celebrating your hard work and the end of the semester please don't make this night any harder on me than it needs to be. If you are planning on celebrating tonight please be mindful of others. While many of you have finished with assessments there are still people who haven't (including myself). With this in mind, to minimise the number of people being disturbed I will be quite tough and strict on noise tonight. The rule is that any gatherings on the residential floors in a room/lounge need to move down to level 2 or the Warren BEFORE 11pm. Noise curfew sets in at 11pm. I will be on rounds around this time. If I can hear you from the corridors I will ask you to move down to level 2/Warren regardless of whether you have received noise complaint yet or not. If I ask you to move down to level 2/Warren that means move ASAP. Tonight if I ask you to move down to level 2/Warren (noise complaint or not) I will wait for you to move down before continuing on rounds or returning to my room to ensure the noise is resolved as fast as possible disturbances are kept to a minimum. It will be much easier for me and all of you if you all take responsibility for yourselves and your gatherings and move down to level 2/Warren before 11pm.
3. Please celebrate/party responsibly, clean up after yourselves (I will note down groups who leave large messes in common spaces) and take care of yourself. As always if you need my help, get locked out or there is an incident/emergency please call me. Make sure you look out for one another and help out one another.

Hi Fenner! So like a lot of people, Tiana Sun and I are moving out into a sharehouse end of this year and like the broke uni students we are, we're trying to furnish the place with as much secondhand stuff as possible - essentially, if you've got any misc furniture that you bought at the start of the year and is now looking like it's not going to fit into storage/that you don't really need anymore, shoot me a message and we'll see if we can work something out!
We're mostly looking for stuff like shelving units or bookshelves, but if you've got literally anything else in your room that you don't really need or want anymore (lamps/bedside tables/tvs/couches/idk what you guys might have in your rooms lol) we would definitely still be interested!

Let's have a cheeky chat about Uluru - The climb up Uluru's surface closed permanently on the weekend and this makes so many of us very happy. Uluru is a sacred men's site for the Anangu people and is home to many sacred watering holes and art. It is powerful and the sunsets are to die for. 34 years ago, the title ownership of Uluru was given back to the Anangu people but they gave the National park a 99-year lease. Although the Anangu have been encouraging people to avoid the climb for years, it was only until much later when it was agreed that the climb would close once the percentage of tourists that climbed it dropped below 20% (i think, im writing from memory), and this decision was followed.
The annoying influx of climbers to Uluru this year was very detrimental to the environment in the region, with many people dropping their black waste throughout the land because they didnt want to wait in line for either of the two dropping locations. Now, Uluru has a white scar and fence marks along its side, which is heartbreaking for the Anangu. Now, they're celebrating because the site can rest and is now protected.
Also, don't call it Ayers rock. That's the colonial name.",0,28,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2318047968324480/

For those that have filled out a returner application for next year and are wondering whether or not you have to do/redo the Consent Matters module...
If you have never completed Consent Matters, you need to do this by tonight or ASAP.
If you know you have completed Consent Matters in the past, ANU states ""If you have previously completed, you are still required to do the module as a refresher course"". However this was not adequately communicated to us so do not stress if you cannot redo it by tonight, it will not affect your application. If you have the time in the near future it would be a good idea to redo it but the main thing is that you have completed it at some point in the past.",4,33,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2300729196723024/

This semester, on Thursdays, we’ll be posting useful information about academic life at ANU. Today is SELT reviews.
Over the past week or so, you should have received emails regarding SELTs for each of your courses. These are the Student Evaluation of Learning and Teaching surveys, and we strongly recommend that you take the time to fill them out. The feedback that you provide goes to the course convenors, tutors and lecturers of the course, as well as to the central ANU Evaluations team. Feedback can genuinely help improve the course from year to year, and although a problem with a course may be obvious to you, it probably isn’t evident to the people running the course.
When you’re choosing your courses for next year, you can see the results of previous years SELT reviews by clicking the link on the Programs and Courses page - this might help you decide how much you're likely to enjoy a course or how useful it may be for you.

Hello Fen fam! As most of you should be aware, Valete is fast approaching (Saturday Oct 26th). It's being held at ANU Union and is the perfect chance to socialize, say goodbye to our grads/those leaving us for sharehouse life, and reminisce on the year that has been. Those who have been to Valete before know that it's one of the best events of the year and certainly not one to miss out on!
The night will include speeches, graduate gifts, and good food -  starting at 5 and concluding at 7. We will then migrate back to Fenner where the courtyard and the Warren will be open. 

TICKETS WILL BE RELEASED THIS WEDNESDAY AT 10AM 
They will be FREE, however numbers are strictly limited so make sure you and your friends get in quick and don't miss out! Make sure to click 'going' to the event page so that you don't miss the event link and password when it's posted!

Lip syncing is an intrinsic part of drag culture, and has historically involved predominately male drag queens miming singing and dancing. Tonight, everyone has a chance to get up on stage, experiment with their clothing choices, and have a great time showing off their lip-syncing prowess!

Here's a classic RuPaul's Drag Race lip sync for some inspiration... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-FTxdg9_w

Sign up here, or come find us to add a song tonight!

This semester, on Thursdays, we’ll be posting useful information about academic life at ANU. Today is ANUSA and PARSA!
ANUSA and PARSA both provide a wide range of student services - ANUSA for undergraduate students, PARSA for postgraduate and research students, although many of the services each offer are available to all students. Their committees are elected by students each year. Examples of what they do include free legal advice, many of the O-Week and Bush Week activities, the Student Space in the Di Riddell building, Universal Lunch Hour and more. They also deal with a wide range of student advocacy issues - if you’re having an issue with something at the university, they will do what they can to help you out. They can help in financial emergencies with short-term loans or grants and provide a wide range of social events throughout the year. For more info, check out their Facebook pages and websites below, or chat to an APO or an SR.

Good evening Fenner,
ISO Tennis is the last sport of the year and our Fenner team is looking damn good! We are up against Ursies tomorrow and we are still looking for ONE MORE FEMALE* RESIDENT to play, so if you are keen to have a hit in some gorgeous weather then let me or our masterful head coach Stuart Donnan know!
To get you hyped for what is sure to be a dominant display tomorrow morning, I'm taking a trip down memory lane and bringing back the player profiles. This time it is the economic overlord of the FRC, Nicki Armstrong!
Name: NICKO MODE
Playing History: Nicki has been studying the intricacies of tennis for most of her life, as she learns all about parabolic functions and escape velocity through her degree.
Preferred Playing Style: All out assault. Nicki is known as the 'smiling assassin' due to her pin point base line shots and brutal force at the net.
Favourite Sledge: 'Some some, someone said ... I'm better than you'",6,14,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2275551235907487/

"Monday, 7 October 2019 at 12:36 pm",Lucas Humbel,"Tennis after match report:
Despite suffering a loss today against Burgmann doesn't mean it wasn't a good day
Facing the thundering serves of the very good Burg singles player, Lucas Humbel demonstrated excellent sportsmanship through his praise and respect of his stronger opponent.
Jess Kremer similarly showcased great respect for her opponent as she dusted off her rust and got back into the swing of things (get it, you swing a racket in tennis)
Liam Dooley and Joel Bourke exemplified teamwork through their scarily similar outfits and Liam had a particularly intimidating second serve
Freya Rose and Nicki Armstrong were by far the stand outs of the day, despite lacking much tennis experience between them almost every game went to deuce and Freya's crosscourt shots had the opponents running and Nicki was by far the most talented newcomer to tennis I have witnessed
Burgmann were too intimidated by the prospect of playing against Stella Jin and a absent Abdullah Nizamani to play, using the excuse of running IB to avoid playing them. Didn't stop Stella hitting an excellent serve that definitely went in seen below",2,18,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2273160986146512/

"Saturday, 5 October 2019 at 8:32 pm",Olivia Dry,"Hi everyone, I know your probably all sick of IB posts by no but this needs to be said.
There are so many people who work tirelessly behind the scenes but people don't tend to see the impact of their work, and these people need to be recognised.
Stuart Donnan works harder than almost anyone I have ever seen. He goes above and beyond to ensure that everything and everyone is organised and working. HE gets little credit for the enormous amount of passion and effort he puts in, and IB could genuinely have been a disaster this year without him. He and all of Fenner should be incredibly proud of this man.
Olivia Dry, despite signing up for way more then she bargained for, Liv has been incredible in her dedication and how hard she has worked to ensure endpoint ran smoothly, despite the many obstacles. She helped ensure mockdrops, dry runs, and endpoint was possible for everyone, and I am so impressed.
Liam Dooley has been the best Head Coach Fenner could have asked for. Not only was he training to run himself, but he has put so much hard work and effort this year into IB, helping runners realise their potential, and making sure everything was possible. He has been a pillar of strength for the IB community and everyone is so grateful.
Jan De Kock has put in the hours to help out all his runners and make sure they feel comfortable and competent to navigate endpoint, and he has taken on extra duties and helped out so much, his love for IB is obvious. Thank you for your endless support, you have been incredible.
Zac Waine is clearly the most dedicated and passionate man to have ever walked this earth when it comes to IB. He has put blood, sweat and tears into IB this year to make sure that it was even possible. He worked crazy hours and went above and beyond, and I have never seen someone so passionate and hardworking at something they love so much. You are truly an inspiration.
The FRC, thank you so much for all your help at endpoint today and throughout the year. Endpoint could not have run so smoothly without you ad I thank you for how hard you worked to make sure we pulled it off. You are all incredible.
And finally to all the volunteers and spectators, your support and Fenner pride was truly mindblowing and I know that you made the runners feel loved and appreciated in their final lengths to endpoint. You are all truly phenomenal, thank you so much.
Thank you, everyone, for an unforgetable year of IB !!XXXX",5,102,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2269926319803312/

"Friday, 4 October 2019 at 1:51 pm",Brynn Berg,"🤩🎉 DIV 5 HYPE - SEND OFF AT 6:45PM 🎉🤩
When you are thinking of prestigious IB divisions, div 5 is probably the first one that comes to mind. This year, Fenner div 5 is coming in with some red hot form (courtesy of Aidan Fryer) and we are ready to put on a show.
Brynn Berg:
Firstly, it must be noted that when Brynn finishes looking like he never even started, it’s not because Grace, Aidan, and I are terribly slow (I am, but we will ignore that), it’s because he is actually a talented runner. It’s like at a primary school gala day when the high school kids rock up to help out and all the little children are left in awe of how big and good they are. Brynn is our high school kid. Ready to shred the trails, the only thing that might stop him is a compass.
Aidan Fryer:
“Oops, forgot to put my sunscreen on, I’ll be there in 5 mins”. “I forgot my pen”. “Sorry guys, I’ll be there in 10”. “Liam, I think I lost your pen”. “I need to put sunscreen behind my ears”. “Someone dropped their pen - oh wait, it was me”. “My chair literally smells like fart”. farts on bench - “This bench is going to need to be replaced”.
Hopefully Aidan won’t loose his pen. Hopefully Aidan will make it to endpoint. Hopefully Aidan won’t get burnt (extremely unlikely). Aidan needs a new chair. Fenner needs a new bench.
Grace Harvey:
“No one is allowed to study between now and IB” - followed 15mins later by commencing late night study. Grace is going to do medicine (flex). But before that, she is going to do IB. She will not hesitate to pull Brynn into line if he tries to test out his sub 40 min 10km during the race, and she will be there if Aidan tries to throw away his pens to give him a clap around the head. Her singing voice will be the key to getting us through the early hours of the morning and she is sure to be coming into endpoint looking fresh.
Liam (me):
How good is running and navigating? I actually dream about maps and have been training extensively all year to run 50km without breaking a sweat. Actually, turns out I prefer a minimalist approach. Training is cheating. So with that in mind, I have had one consistent week of running this year and I plan to watch a YouTube video on how to use a compass after I post this. I was getting a bit concerned typing this but then I remember I’m only the navigator. No stress. See you at endpoint on Monday.
Don’t miss div 5 send off out the front of Fenner at 6:45pm and get to Endpoint on Saturday (see event pages in Fenner Hall for send off and endpoint!)",2,41,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2267467120049232/

"Friday, 4 October 2019 at 3:07 pm",Jan,"Introducing…. Olsson-Terry-Small-Kock
Forget div 1, div 6 are the real heroes of Fenner IB. With our undeniable girl power (and also Jan) and our *secret* plan to perform a 120km detour just to flex on div 1, every other IB team better watch out.
First I introduce our Nav Jan! As head Nav coach you would hope his nav skills are better than his brownie cooking abilities. But considering his brownie cooking abilities are non-existent, they won’t be hard to beat. As Jan has bet div 5 that we will reach endpoint first, he will undoubtably be the voice of encouragement when things get tough. However, since the consequence of losing is talking a dip in the civic fountain, I’m sure the rest of us wont be too upset if we lose.
Next we have our fantastic co-nav Ruby!!!! As someone who is way too qualified for this role she’s definitely got our back if we may find ourselves… lost. She also draws a MEAN scout map which I am not at all jealous of. During our first run as a div she oh so calmly informed us that she had a *minor* rib breakage, but don’t worry, its ok, she feels fine. Despite this, Ruby was the one who suggested we take a detour to flex on div 1, so she’s not going to let a minor broken rib slow her down.
Next we have the self-proclaimed div mum Sabrina!!!! She is the perfect mix of sweet and strict and is not afraid to discipline the div when we make terrible mistakes (like letting Jan try to make brownies). Sabrina knows more than her fair share of fun body facts and is not afraid to share them with us whenever she can. I can assure you we will all come back from IB much more mature and knowledgeable, whether we like it or not.
Finally we have myself, ironically, not the smallest on the team. As the only one who isn’t from the middle of Sydney you would think I would know my way around the bush, but you would be very mistaken. As someone who is scared of both spiders and the dark, running around in an ambiguous location (hopefully) somewhere in Australia is in fact my favourite hobby. But its ok, I have a full 24 hours to completely overcome these fears.
Come to endpoint to see div 6 absolutely smash IB, or maybe just come to see Jan’s face when he finds out he has to go for a swim in the civic fountain, whichever you prefer.

"Friday, 4 October 2019 at 12:06 pm",Rowan,"Alright alright its the Fantastic “Div” 4 IB team!!!!!! This superhero div more awesome and wholesome than the og foursome is more than ready take on the fearsome challenge of Inward Bound. This Div has a solid plan of avoiding all train tracks and will be singing their way across the finish line so be sure to be there to cheer them on.
Heading the team with some prime navigation and pastoral care skills is Rowan “more fantastic than mr fantastic” Davie. With the wisdom of a sea turtle (think Crush off Finding Nemo), Rowan’s overwhelmingly calming aura is complemented by is his equally soothing voice. Keep an eye out for a funky change to his luscious locks today when you seem him at send off. Today an SR… but tomorrow a champion.
Next up is Phoebe “clearly not invisible” Spurrier. Phoebe is so at one with nature that she will be running with an empty pack because she only needs photosynthesis to survive (pls follow @phoebsplants for more info). If you have ever run behind Phoebe down a hill, you will know that her excitable dinosaur arm is the only entertainment you need when running 70km through the wilderness.
If you see Nat “more rugged than the thing” Walkom around today, please remind him to join the rest of the team for send off at 5:15pm as the team truly never knows where Nat is, ever. Swapping rock climbing for running, Nat is definitely just as capable of moving horizontally as well as vertically as he is always leading the pack.
Finally we have Callum “hotter than the human torch” Bryan. Sure his baby face and preppy British accent may charm you but the 2019 IB course won’t know what’s hit it because Callum isn’t letting anything get between him and the pie waiting for him at endpoint. With his royal blue thermals and legs for days, Callum is a sight to see leaping and bounding with the grace and speed of a gazelle.
Over and out (at least for the next 10 hours as they run) XOXO Div 4 aka Agents sea turtle, squirrel, mountain goat and gazelle",3,62,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2267340130061931/

Division: 3
Distance: Too far
Team: Sexy
Send Off Time: 4:15 PM
Expected EP arrival time: Tomorrow (probably)
Fenner Friends, listen close…
Today marks the eve of the only event that I have ever chosen over attending my Friday 8AM tutorial. The 2019 IB slog ends tomorrow and Div 3 is planning on making a BIG appearance. We’re all keen as fruit-loops and hella excited to hit the midnight air and get cracking along the road to our destiny (yeah that’s right, we have depth). We might only have half a team of Fenner ressies, but we’ll fight hard to make you proud.
Jess Algar. Team mascot and certified legend. Jess is one cool cucumber and has the most energy-efficient running style of all time. When the rest of us run ourselves to exhaustion, it is Jess’ role to carry us through. She’s always ready to share a smile and offer support. She can easily cop all grief the smack we throw at her and will take it in her smooth stride. While no longer technically a Fenner ressie, Jess has the peculiar role of backing Fenner in the face of Bruce Hall. Jess is our rock.
Chris Brown. Rumour has it that this man is bringing a comb to groom his mane before he sees you all at endpoint. “Look good, run good” says Chris. Whether that is true or not, it is an eternal truth that this man has enough spirit to carry our whole team on his shoulders. We’re all very excited for his midrace meditation sessions and we are stoked to have someone so positive to keep us going. Thank god for Chrissy B.
Simon Davie. Having retreated to Northbourne, we don’t get to see Simo as much as we would like. Luckily though, we have ~12 hours booked with him tonight. Simo is personally responsible for working out exactly where we are when we land from our whirlwind bus trip, and he is in no way feeling the pressure of that immense task. We mightn’t admit it to him, but Simo is probably capable of running double the distance that the rest of us can, we’ll be fighting to hold this fast boi back.
Courtesy of Chrissy B:
Jackson Taylor. The Chief Navigator and unofficial team captain. He has a dry sense of humour and a consistent positivity which will drive us home to End Point. This is Jackson’s second year of IB so he’s got the tips and tricks. Jackson will be running with a stylish Watermelon themed bucket hat to keep his opaque skin from the October sun. The man is highly proficient in pretending he knows what he’s doing and as long as all go along with it, we all benefit from the confidence and calmness this provides. Jacko will hold us together and with all his shit talking, will drive us to victory (finishing).
We look forward to seeing you all at send off this afternoon, and tomorrow when we roll into endpoint looking phresh as ever. Much love xx

YOU WILL HEAR ROWAN’S LUCIOUS VOICE ON THE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCING IT!!

tdlr: A bit about the family running 100km. Defs worth the read though.

Ah Fenner Div 1, or as we really know them; The Family. This glorious Nuclear Family has been shown to be more dysfunctional than Lockie’s emotional state. The constant shit stirring, primarily inspired by Zeus is going to the bane of Maddie’s existence and with Jones laughing at everything he has to say, Zeus is bound to definitely not shut up. But let’s not dwell on such things just yet, let me introduce you to the team.
Dad (Lachlan Jones): Dad as of now, has taught his children a very unique way to breathe as loudly as possible while running. Aside from this the only bonding experience either Junior or JJ have had with Dad is the constant disappointment he has seeing them with their poor dieting and alcoholism. That being said, Dad is still loved by everyone in the family and without such a father-figure, I’m sure his kids would just end up annoying some other sucker.
Mum (Maddie Wait): Mum is not only the most experienced member of the family, but the most mature as well. She has been providing some solid advice, gear recommendations and very helpful tips. Despite this, because of the idiots they are all, Dad, Junior and JJ don’t seem to give a single shit. While they may be the downfall, we all have faith that Maddie will single handedly carry the entire team to the finish line and that’s why the rest of the family appreciate her.
Junior (Locklyn Krukz): Junior, without being too rude, is an absolute shithead. Inspired by JJ’s banter compiled with his poor decision-making skills, Junior is bound to end up pressing the ‘red evacuation button’ on the emergency phone just to see a firefighter. He’ll no doubt sneak an energy drink and speaker on the run to blast a genre of music that closely resembles dying animals. Unlike both Dad and Mum, I’m sure the Family could easily do without Junior.
JJ (Zeus-Jesse): JJ, being the youngest brother, has absolutely no filter when it comes to his banter. Every ten seconds on the bus he’ll no doubt be asking whether “we’re there yet” letting everyone know he “needs to go to the toilet?”. This will only Be worse on the run as he’ll ask Dad to give him a piggy-back. Whilst JJ is the cuter Junior, these admiring looks by the spectators will probably be the only thing he’ll give to the team. Obviously being younger, Mum and Dad care about him more and would much rather him on the team than Junior.",0,52,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2267181463411131/

Hello friends!
We have 16 availible spots for cars if you're keen to come to end point! For these spots, you would have to be willing to potentially transport volunteers to and/or from endpoint and some be able to take runners back from endpoint. I need some cars willing to drive volunteers for early shifts (i.e. 7am) as the spectator (which most volunteers should be on) bus wont arrive on time!
Important note: Cars do NOT need comprehensive insurance! So much easier to lend a hand for End point!!!
Here is the form to sign up below, and please MESSAGE me because I need to coordinate who will be going in what car for endpoint.
https://forms.gle/nT49aLpdVuVEddZz8
People who sign up via the car rego form will then receive a confirmation email and indemnity form to sign. They can only drive to EP if they have filled out the indemnity form and have a confirmation email. REMINDER that any parents/non-ANU people driving need to email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com.
Note: If you have someone at college with an ACCESSIBILITY requirement (or anyone's family member) who would like to come to EP, please email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com

This I will I'll be shedding some light on words that we (Aboriginal People) use in general conversation - mainly because sometimes I drop words and y'all are likely confused.
Gammon - fake, pathetic or to pretend.
Deadly - Awesome or great
Tidda - means sister, can be used for your female friends
Yidaki - Yolngu word for didgeridoo (didgeridoo was coined by colonists)
Budoo - 🍆(I have big budoo energy xoxo)
Doori - sex
Sistergirl - the women in our community, usually used to refer to transwomen
Brotherboy - the men in our community, usually used to refer to transmen
Shame - that's embarrassing
Shamejob - to embarrass, humiliate
Shakealeg - Aboriginal dancing
Gubba - white person
Mob - family or kin
Country - our land and home. We capitalise this word.
Language - when referring to speaking in our home languages, we refer to it as 'speaking in language'.
Don't even bother asking about the family system (who's a sis, cuz, brotha), you won't get it.
Hope y'all feel educated!

TL;DR Sign up to be an official college car for transport to and from end point!! (PLEASE message me if you sign the form as it goes to IB)
Hello friends!
We have 16 availible spots for cars if you're keen to come to end point! For these spots, you would have to be willing to potentially transport volunteers to and/or from endpoint and some be able to take runners back from endpoint. I need some cars willing to drive volunteers for early shifts (i.e. 7am) as the spectator (which most volunteers should be on) bus wont arrive on time!
Important note: Cars do NOT need comprehensive insurance! So much easier to lend a hand for End point!!!
Here is the form to sign up below, and please MESSAGE me because I need to coordinate who will be going in what car for endpoint.
https://forms.gle/nT49aLpdVuVEddZz8
People who sign up via the car rego form will then receive a confirmation email and indemnity form to sign. They can only drive to EP if they have filled out the indemnity form and have a confirmation email. REMINDER that any parents/non-ANU people driving need to email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com.
Note: If you have someone at college with an ACCESSIBILITY requirement (or anyone's family member) who would like to come to EP, please email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com

Link to feedback form: https://forms.gle/mH2zijLY72JFVuEMA
Hey Fenner,
I am planning on moving a motion in the AGM to create a new type of FRC body known as 'associations'.
Associations are designed to be funded by the FRC but remain relatively independent of it. I have done this mainly to give Fenner Green a more prominent role in the hall.
Currently, Fenner Green is often perceived as a club and the Terms of Reference only provides some recommendation as to how this group should be structured. Fenner Green has too of an important role to be classified as a club. This motion seeks to solve that by creating a body that is different to a club.
The motion also provides a way to establish new associations.
The motion also removes the GSEAs and ISA from the Terms of Reference. This is because these groups although funded by the FRC are administered by admin. The GSEAs and ISA have also expressed concern about being in the Terms of Reference because it associates them too closely to the FRC.
More info is provided at the end of the motion itself.
If you would like to have your say or ask specific questions, please fill out the feedback form and I'll endeavour to get back to you. 😀",0,20,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2258430110952933/

Good morning Fenner,
The FRC AGM will occur on Saturday 12 October this year at the Copland Theatre. The AGM is a great way to discuss ideas about Fenner's future and implement lasting changes in the hall, so please come along and be involved! A ton of free food will be provided too so how good are incentives!
However, the other reason I am posting is to provide a preliminary explanation about the vote regarding IB scheduled for the AGM.
After my Sports Master and VP reports are passed, I will do a presentation explaining the reasoning for, and implications of, this vote. I will:
- Provide an overview of Fenner IB in 2017 and 2018 and outline the issues we encountered in those years;
- Explain the changes made to Fenner IB in 2019 and acknowledge the clear successes we have had this year;
- Breakdown the IB budget and explain its place within the broader FRC budget;
- Go through my correspondence with the IB Race Directors and outline the issues I have with their observations;
- Outline the positives and negatives of staying in IB in 2020; and
- Outline the positives and negatives of leaving IB in 2020.
After my presentation, I will allow for questions and statements for the audience. In the interest of time, this portion will likely be restricted, so please prepare well in advance. Afterwards, the vote will commence.
I will not be posting my presentation in advance of the AGM so that nothing in it can be misconstrued.
I am happy to answer any questions you may have in the meantime about the vote. Please send me a message or approach me in person!
I have attached the AGM Event link so you are able to see the other issues that will be discussed there.
Thus, I highly recommend you attend the AGM as this vote will have a massive impact on Fenner in 2020.

Good evening Fenner,
Want to send off 2019 in the right way? Want a cracking night of awards, free food and top notch banter? Want to see Etay cry when his Chat King crown is taken away from him? Then get ready for FENNER god damn SPARTOS!!!
What is Spartos you ask? It is the night where we recognise the achievements of Fenner ressies in Sports, Arts and Social in 2019, and also hand out a few joke awards too. It is a great night filled with laughs so make sure you are there!
Here is a run down of the event:
1. FREE FOOD from YARRA FUCKING KEBABS at 6:30pm provided by your FRC
2. AWARDS starting at 7:30pm in the COURTYARD
3. The WARREN will be serving all the beverages you will need (so no BYO this year, Sober Reps will be on alert)
4. The theme is 2000's as Fenner now has ressies who were born in the new millennium! Keen to see some shocking outfits!
We will be posting a form soon so you can vote for who will win the joke awards, and keep an eye out for your name when we post the nominees for the serious awards in the coming weeks.

Hello friends!
We have 16 availible spots for cars if you're keen to come to end point! For these spots, you would have to be willing to potentially transport volunteers to and/or from endpoint and some be able to take runners back from endpoint. I need some cars willing to drive volunteers for early shifts (i.e. 7am) as the spectator (which most volunteers should be on) bus wont arrive on time!
Important note: Cars do NOT need comprehensive insurance! So much easier to lend a hand for End point!!!
Here is the form to sign up below, and please MESSAGE me because I need to coordinate who will be going in what car for endpoint.
https://forms.gle/nT49aLpdVuVEddZz8
People who sign up via the car rego form will then receive a confirmation email and indemnity form to sign. They can only drive to EP if they have filled out the indemnity form and have a confirmation email. REMINDER that any parents/non-ANU people driving need to email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com.
Note: If you have someone at college with an ACCESSIBILITY requirement (or anyone's family member) who would like to come to EP, please email ibracedirector2019@gmail.com

This semester, on Thursdays, we’ll be posting useful information about academic life at ANU. Today is Global Programs!
These are the people to talk to if you want to go on exchange. They can give you information about how the application process works, how to choose an exchange partner and what sorts of opportunities are available. The process of organising an exchange can be long and confusing - as many current Fenner ressies who’ve been on exchange can tell you - so make sure you get on it early! We recommend starting to plan an exchange at least a year in advance so you can ensure that it’ll fit with your degree and have plenty of time to make important decisions.
Global Programs have drop-in sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9-12 on level 3 of Di Riddell, or you can find their email and phone number at the web address below. Check out their Facebook page for more info and follow it for updates!

As some of you would be aware we have been trying to get feedback from ressies about the NOUS recommendations and how to implement them in Fenner Hall.
The Nous recommendations were produced by the request of the ANU in response to the AHRC report on Sexual Assault on University Campuses.
These recommendations are designed to help us continue to build safe and inclusive communities. Attached is our current plans to address these recommendations which will have an impact on anyone living here in 2020 including how events are run and advertised, how the O Week program is run for incoming first years and other aspects of life.
Would be awesome if you (the person who has read this far already) could have a look at these recommendations and give us feedback on our current planned response.",8,21,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2248300321965912/

Have you wanted to get involved in IB, but hate any kind of physical activity, or maybe left it to late, or just didn't know where to start? Well here is a great opportunity to get involved without too much physical exertion. Next week we will be holding RAOK for our IB runners to help them get through this stressful time. The weeks leading up to IB are a trying time for our fellow ressies, and a nice RAOK gift here and there throughout the next week could give them the strength they need to pull through. 

There will be a $10 maximum and you can either choose which ressies you would like to gift for or we can randomly allocate you, but obviously, they must be running IB.

"Tuesday, 24 September 2019 at 2:28 pm",,"Hello friends! Welcome to Indigenous Hour, ft. the sickest beats from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, plus yours truly!
This weeks' topics is pretty hard for me to write about but it's super important to know, so please note that some of this is simply copied and pasted from online sources that I trust. I'll be giving you some information about the Stolen Generations so please only read if you have the emotional energy.

.
The Stolen Generations refers to all the Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their families between the 1890s and 1970s as a result of government policy. It broke important cultural, spiritual and family ties and has left a lasting and intergenerational impact on the lives and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
The government and states implemented many laws regarding Aboriginal people in the 20th century. These laws meant nearly every aspect of the lives of Indigenous people was closely controlled by government: relationships and marriage, children, work, travel, wages, housing and land, and access to health care and education.
The forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families was part of the policy of Assimilation. Essentially, the Assimilation policy was forcing Aboriginal women to marry white men to create lighter children. They aimed to create a cycle where Aboriginal people would eventually 'die out', thus removing the Aboriginal 'problem'. This is why so many of us have light skin but are still considered Aboriginal within our communities. Our communities recognise that Aboriginality is deeper than skin colour (that the government defined it by).
Children taken from their parents as part of the Stolen Generation were taught to reject their Indigenous heritage, and forced to adopt white culture. Their names were often changed, and they were forbidden to speak their traditional languages. Some children were adopted by white families, and many were placed in institutions where abuse and neglect were common.
For the children who were taken:
Many were psychologically, physically, and sexually abused while living in state care or with their adoptive families.
Efforts to make stolen children reject their culture often caused them to feel ashamed of their      Indigenous heritage.
Many children were wrongly told that their parents had died or abandoned them, and many never knew where they had been taken from or who their biological families were.
Living conditions in the institutions were highly controlled, and children were frequently punished harshly, were cold and hungry and received minimal if any affection.
The children generally received a very low level of education, as they were expected to work as manual labourers and domestic servants.
Medical experts have noted a high incidence of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and suicide among the Stolen Generations
The removal of several generations of children severely disrupted Indigenous oral culture, and consequently, much cultural knowledge was lost.
Many of the Stolen Generations never experienced living in a healthy family situation, and never learned parenting skills. In some instances, this has resulted in generations of children raised in state care
The Bringing them home report:
The harm done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children during this period was comprehensively documented and acknowledged for the first time through the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, established in 1995.
According to this report, between one in ten and one in three Aboriginal children were stolen in this period.
The report also noted that 'the overwhelming evidence is that the impact does not stop with the children removed. It is inherited by their own children in complex and sometimes heightened ways'. The unresolved trauma and grief from this period created a cycle of grief and trauma. Aboriginal people face higher rates of mental illness, incarceration, suicide, substance abuse and violence, which can all be linked back to the Stolen Generations.
The Apology
In 2008, the Rudd Government apologised for the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families. However, children are being taken from their families at a greater rate now than at the time of the Apology so go figure.
___________________________
Regardless of how this time period is discussed/hidden/justified, Aboriginal people suffered cultural and actual genocide and this should not be denied. The trauma we suffer is still real and it is something that I have to live with personally. I do not know if my family was stolen. My own Nanna refuses to talk about our history as it hurts her, but considering the location of my mob and the colour of my skin, I wouldn't be surprised if my ancestors were ripped from their homes and indoctrinated.

It'll be lots of fun, you'll get like 2-3 glasses of wine and some cheese and meet some lovely people <3",3,2,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2233487850113826/

Instead, I'm going to see if I can display the artwork on the pinboards around the Warren for a bit - so if you submitted an image of a physical drawing I'd be happy to put up the original, just let me know!",2,21,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2231955226933755/

While our runners are training hard to give Inward Bound their best shot, we are in desperate need of volunteers to help out on the weekend of the event and at endpoint. This is a super great way to get involved in IB and support Fenner, all without having to do any running!

Here at the Fenner Social Cricket Club (FSCC) we are captivated by much more than just the gameplay. There have been some major contributors to the culture of the cricketing world - and the late Bob Hawke ranks highly amongst them. His annual scull at the SCG was nothing short of inspiring, and will be dearly missed. Here is to Bob! Let us carry his spirit with us in the season to come.
Join the group below and come to training tomorrow at 9AM!!!",3,17,https://www.facebook.com/groups/fennerhall/permalink/2228892163906728/
